Code smells are a result of poor or misguided programming. These blips in the application code can often be directly traced to mistakes made by the application programmer during the coding process.

Smells are certain structures in the code that indicate violation of fundamental design principles and negatively impact design quality. in order to fix that, I applied SOLID principles and architecural patterns.

The goal of the SOLID principles is to reduce dependencies so that we can change one area of software without impacting others. Additionally, theyâ€™re intended to make designs easier to understand, maintain, and extend. Ultimately, using these design principles makes it easier for software engineers to avoid issues and to build adaptive, effective, and agile software.

I order to apply these principles, I splitted every class in three classes to put the data logic and gesign related entities appart. The Controller is the boumding part of the process. It traks the changes the data in moule and updates view when needed.
